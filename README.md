# UnityPlanets
Full-scale procedural planet generator in Unity with lots of graphics tricks including:
- Scaled-space approach for rendering full-size planets
- Geometry shader grass, fully integrated into Unity's forward and deferred rendering pipelines
- Custom light shapes (capsule + box), integrated into Unity's deferred rendering pipeline
- Screen-space atmosphere as a post-process
- Custom tree generator with animated leaves

## Planned
------
- VR support
- Place trees on the surface, with billboarding in the distance
- Randomly generated dungeons to place on the surface
- Better (physically based) clouds
- Better drag/atmosphere model
